## CQRS
Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) is a pattern that separates the read and write operations of a data store. 
This is done by having separate models for reading and writing. 

The read model is optimized for reading and the write model is optimized for writing. 
This allows for the read model to be scaled independently of the write model. 
This is useful for applications that have a high read to write ratio.
