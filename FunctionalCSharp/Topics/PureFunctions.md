# Pure Functions

## Characteristics

### Deterministic output: 

For any given input, a pure function will always yield the same output,
making its behavior extremely predictable. This characteristic simplifies the process of testing
and debugging since the output of the function is always consistent given the same set of inputs.

### No observable side effects: 

A pure function does not influence or is influenced by an external
state. This means it doesn’t modify any external variables or data structures, or even carry out
I/O operations. The function’s sole effect is the computation it performs and the result it delivers.

## benefits of Pure functions

### Predictability and ease of testing: 

Due to their deterministic nature, pure functions are highly predictable, 
making it easy to write unit tests. 

You always know what output to expect for a specific input, and there’s no need to mock or set up external dependencies for testing.

### Code reusability and modularity: 

Pure functions, when designed to focus on a specific task in line with the single-responsibility principle, 
become highly reusable. As they don’t depend on external states, 
you can move these functions without worrying about breaking the code or enhancing its modularity.

### Ease of debugging and maintenance: 

Without shared state or side effects, debugging pure functions is just a breeze. 
If there’s an issue, it’s usually within the function itself, making it easy to spot and fix. 

The isolation of pure functions also facilitates maintenance and updates as you can change a function 
without affecting other parts of your code.
