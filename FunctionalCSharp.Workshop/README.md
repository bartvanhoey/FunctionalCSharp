# How to Write Code in a Clean and Functional Style in C#

This workshop is designed to help you learn how to write code in a clean and functional style in C#. 
The workshop is divided into a series of exercises that will guide you through the process of writing clean and functional code in C#.

## Prerequisites

To complete this workshop, you will need:

- [.NET 9](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0)
- A text editor or IDE such as Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio
- Basic knowledge of C#
- A willingness to learn!

## Getting Started

what are the techniques that we can use to write code in a clean and functional style?

why writing clean and functional code is important?




what are the benefits of writing clean and functional code?
 
- **Simplicity**: Keep your code simple and easy to understand.
- **Clarity**: Make your code clear and easy to read.
- **Consistency**: Be consistent in your code style and naming conventions.
- **Modularity**: Break your code into small, reusable modules.
- **Abstraction**: Hide the complexity of your code behind simple interfaces.


- **Immutability**: Avoid changing the state of objects after they are created.
- **Pure Functions**: Functions that always return the same output for the same input and that do not have side effects.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions that take other functions as arguments.
- **Recursion**: A technique for solving problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems.
- **Pattern Matching**: A way to match values against patterns.
- **Pipelines**: A way to compose functions together to create a pipeline of operations.
- **Monads**: A way to handle side effects in a functional way.
- **Unit Testing**: A way to test your code to ensure it works as expected.

- **Modularity**: Break your code into small, reusable modules.
- **Abstraction**: Hide the complexity of your code behind simple interfaces.
- **Encapsulation**: Keep the implementation details of your code hidden.
- **Composition**: Compose small, simple functions together to create complex behavior.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Separate the different concerns of your code into different modules.
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each module should have a single responsibility.
- **Don't Repeat Yourself**: Avoid duplicating code.
- **Keep It DRY**: Don't Repeat Yourself.
- boy scout rule: Leave the code cleaner than you found it.
- **YAGNI**: You Aren't Gonna Need It.
- **KISS**: Keep It Simple, Stupid.
- **DRY**: Don't Repeat Yourself.
- **SOLID Principles**: A way to design your code that is easy to maintain and extend.
  - **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each module should have a single responsibility.
  - **Open/Closed Principle**: Modules should be open for extension but closed for modification.
  - **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types.
  - **Interface Segregation Principle**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
  - **Dependency Inversion Principle**: Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.
- **Functional Programming**: A way to write code that is based on mathematical functions.
